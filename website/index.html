   <h3><em>What</em> Jukebox?</h3>

   Tam (Track Attribute Manager) jukebox is a system that randomly picks
   songs to play, and considers
   every track you have to be in every playlist--until you say otherwise.
   Then it plays them with a relative frequency depending on how much
   you think they suck. Simple.

   <h3>Sounds Nice, Can I Run It?</h3>

   The odds are that you probably can't run it! At the moment it requires
   a mono platform that has ESound (esd), and Gtk# which I believe limits
   you to recent releases of Linux and some of its closer friends. Someday
   it will run on Windows, if the GStreamer team ever decides to finalize
   their API.

   <h3>Downloads</h3>

   There are no Windows(TM) installers or unix packages right now, but
   there is a spiffy snapshot with <u>almost</u> all the binaries and patches
   you need to run it. See the 
   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106358">SourceForge 
     download page</a> to see what's available.
