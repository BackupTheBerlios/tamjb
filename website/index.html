    <p>It's sort of like shuffle play, but with a SUCK button.</p>

   <h3><em>What</em> Jukebox?</h3>

   Track Attribute Management JukeBox (Tamjb) is a music player that 
   randomly picks songs to play, based on how much you think they suck.
  </div>

  <div class="little_paragraph">
   <h4>It Makes No Assumptions</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>It considers
     every track to be in every playlist until you say otherwise.</li>
    <li>It chooses tracks with a relative frequency depending on how much
     you think they suck.</li>
    <li>If a song sucks, you push the button, and the
     jukebox learns a <em>valuable lesson</em> about your opinion.</li>
  </div>
  <div class="little_paragraph">
   <h4>A Story About The Big Button Labeled Suck</h4>
   The first user interface had just one button, the
   <b>Suck</b> button. And it was good, but it was not quite
   complete. Sometimes a song did not suck, but was merely wrong for the
   current mood. Sometimes the jukebox was listened to by different people.
   So, the concept of mood and user were added, and it was better.
  </div>
  <div class="little_paragraph">
   <h4>Because You Can't Be Negative All The Time</h4>
   It became obvious that some
   of these moods were actually not moods, for example "rockin" or 
   "Downtempo". And the listeners, because they were end users of the software
   and therefore irrational and demanding, expressed a wish to combine several
   moods at once.
  </div>
  <div class="little_paragraph">
   But the programmers did not wish to add these features yet,
   because it was &quot;difficult&quot;. As a compromise, the moods were stored 
   in the database as
   track <em>attributes</em>, and managed by the Track Attribute Manager. 
  </div>
  <div class="little_paragraph">
   And so, in fire and hot water, TAM is born.
  </div>

  <div class="little_paragraph">
  <h3>Some Features</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>It plays MP3 format files at 44.1kHz. And nothing else at this
       time.</li>
     <li>Reads song information from ID3V2 tags.</li>
     <li>Web interface allows remote control of your jukebox from anywhere
       in the house (or work, if you're streaming to yourself somehow.)</li>
     <li>Multi-band leveling with limiting and soft clipping. Linear-phase
       FIR crossovers for minimal artifacts. It sounds good, but boy does
       it use CPU!</li>
     <li>Allows multiple users to log in, and tries to please them all.
       Note that if too many people log in, this means you get boring
       music. (This is also how modern radio stations work!)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="little_paragraph">
   <h3>System Requirements</h3>

   If you have a modern linux, you can probably run the jukebox. All development
   is now done using Debian. WindowsTM is not currently supported, because 
   TamJB uses Esound for audio output. Someday GStreamer will be complete, 
   and a Windows port may become available. (And Duke Nukem Forever will ship, 
   too.) What I'm saying is, you want a Debian system with some stock packages,
   or any other Linux and the ability to install software without sending
   annoying emails to the author.
  </div>

  <div class="little_paragraph">
   Hardware-wise, it will run on a Pentium 3. However, you'll have to
   turn off the more advanced leveling features, and your machine will
   work pretty hard. An AMD64 3000+ is adequate. You can also disable
   most of the DSP and run it on a slower system, but you'll want to use
   some sort of outboard audio equalization.
  </div>

  <div class="little_paragraph">
   <h3>Big Plans</h3>
   
   Oh, you know how every project seems to say &quot;This project
   aims to solve every possible user need and also
   contains a dynamically scalable automobile trading system, recipe
   manager, and open source replacement for Google and eBay.&quot; 
   I'm not quite that ambitious, but some of these ideas might be:

   <ul>
     <li>Should calculate or use unique song ID's based on bitzi, the
       freedb CD signatures, or some other standard, so that songs
       will retain their information when moved.
     <li>Should be some way to trade song information with peers. 
     <li>Support for Ogg/Vorbis/FLAC. mp3 is so 1999.
   </ul>
