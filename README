Check the readme in the tamjb/ directory.

You don't have to build the other libraries separately at this time.

What the other libraries are:

  esd-sharp: a c# library that uses esd for sound output.
    - I keep thinking this will be obsoleted, but GStreamer is
      like a huge glacier.

  mp3sharp: a port of the java mp3 player to c#. Pretty bitchin.

  dojo-baked: a copy of the baked version of dojo, for convenience.
