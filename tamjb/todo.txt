TODO
 Create ebuilds for esd-sharp and mp3sharp, eliminating the need for 
 wrapper makefiles, etc.

 Bug: If a playlist is enabled (say, the "Suck" button is enabled) and a new
 file is found by the file scanner, that file is never played until the
 Suck playlist is disabled and then reenabled. (Because it is not in the
 track_attribute table yet.) 
 
   To fix, add files to all track_attribute types that exist when adding.
   This implies that the TRACK_ATTRIBUTE types should be normalized. Which
   would certainly be a good thing(TM).
 
 Delay-sign assemblies, and sign them on release, or alternatively allow
 signing using a common developer key. To seal in freshness.

 There is a fat memory leak in the server.

 If a file does not have a ID3v2 tag, it will not be played. This is
 technically NOT a bug. Truncated ID3v1 song names are really sad, and
 if a file doesn't have any ID3 info at all, you should probably go 
 through and tag it with a tagger program!

 There are a lot of incomplete features.

DONE
