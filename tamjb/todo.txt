TODO
 - Fix memory leak
  No leak when playing
  Leak when loading new song (handle/buffer leak in Player?)
  Leak when remoting calls occur (possible database resource leak?)

 - Move all engine state into the database, and convert remoting 
  interfaces to use one-shot objects.

 - Implement delete/copy user/mood

 - Add user controls for the compression and limiting

 - Calculate average song volume and store for later level adjustment

 - Create ebuilds for esd-sharp and mp3sharp, eliminating the need for 
  wrapper makefiles, etc.

 - If a file does not have a ID3v2 tag, it will not be played. This is
  NOT a bug. But, there should be a flag in the database so that when an 
  untagged file is found, it will be added with a provisional tag 
  (truncated filename?) and rescanned periodically.


DONE
  Major performance enhancement from improvements to Mp3Sharp's
  buffering.

  Added suck/mood percent display in track list.

  You can now modify the attributes of a song that is not playing by
  selecting it in the list

  New, improved controls layout.

  Compression and soft limiting to even out that listening experience.
  (May not be suitable for music with long, quiet passages: ie 
  classical. Your mileage may vary.)

  PostgreSQL support. SQLite seems to lock the filesystem or something,
  causing dropouts. Postgres seems better about this.

  Added per-user and per-mood song attributes. (Log in: how do you feel?)

  Interface / database redesign to accomodate users and moods instead
  of track attributes.

  Added Unsynchronization support to the id3 tag reader

  Added strong-signing for all assemblies, including third-party assemblies

  Rearranged the project

  Added id3 tag reader, removed dependency on unknown-license id3 tag reader

  Updated the patch for mp3sharp to fix that infinite loop problem.

  Reversed the name so the year comes first. This makes more sense, right?

  Initial release.
