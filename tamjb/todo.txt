TODO
 - Move all engine state into the database, and convert remoting 
  interfaces to use one-shot objects.

 - Create ebuilds for esd-sharp and mp3sharp, eliminating the need for 
  wrapper makefiles, etc.

 - There is a fat memory leak in the server.
  Mostly fixed. Still seems to leak slowly when scanning for files. 
  Wonder if there's a file resource leak? Or maybe I'm imagining it.

 - If a file does not have a ID3v2 tag, it will not be played. This is
  technically NOT a bug. Truncated ID3v1 song names are really sad, and
  if a file doesn't have any ID3 info at all, you should probably go 
  through and tag it with a tagger program!

  HOWEVER, there should be a flag in the database so that when an 
  untagged file is found, it will be added but when you are scanning
  it will check again to see if an id3v2 tag has been added!

 - There are a lot of incomplete features.


DONE
  Interface / database redesign to accomodate users and moods instead
  of track attributes.

  Updated the patch for mp3sharp to fix that infinite loop problem.

  Reversed the name so the year comes first. This makes more sense, right?
