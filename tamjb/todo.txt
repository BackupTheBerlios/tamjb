TODO
 - Move all engine state into the database, and convert remoting 
  interfaces to use one-shot objects.

 - Redesign interface & database to 

 - Create ebuilds for esd-sharp and mp3sharp, eliminating the need for 
  wrapper makefiles, etc.

 - Bug: If a playlist is enabled (say, the "Suck" button is enabled) and a new
  file is found by the file scanner, that file is never played until the
  Suck playlist is disabled and then reenabled. (Because it is not in the
  track_attribute table yet.) 
 
  To fix, add files to all track_attribute types that exist when adding.
  This implies that the TRACK_ATTRIBUTE types should be normalized. Which
  would certainly be a good thing(TM).
 
 - There is a fat memory leak in the server.

 - If a file does not have a ID3v2 tag, it will not be played. This is
  technically NOT a bug. Truncated ID3v1 song names are really sad, and
  if a file doesn't have any ID3 info at all, you should probably go 
  through and tag it with a tagger program!

 - There are a lot of incomplete features.

  Updated the patch for mp3sharp to fix that infinite loop problem.

  Reversed the name so the year comes first. This makes more sense, right?
